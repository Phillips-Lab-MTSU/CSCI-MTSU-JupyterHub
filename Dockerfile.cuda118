## Specific version of bokeh to
## make pip-installed gensim
## happy...
#    bokeh==2.3.3 \
#    pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir \
#    gensim && \

# NOTES 2023-01-16
# keras-nlp - is not in condaforge at
#    time of build. Using pip, but two
#    depends remained: tensorflow-hub
#    and tensorflow-text. Found TF-hub
#    in conda, so added that to the
#    list of conda packages. TF-text
#    is just included as a dependency
#    of keras-nlp during the install
#    process (just remove tf-hub from
#    conda list once keras-nlp finally
#    gets added at some point in the
#    future).
#    The above approach did not work...
#    There were incompatible symbols
#    and no way to resolve without
#    rebuilding. Drop keras-nlp for
#    now until it is in conda since
#    there seems to be no way to make
#    the conda/pip packages play
#    nicely together.
